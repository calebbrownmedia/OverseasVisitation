This choropleth map showcases Overseas Visitiation in 2023, with data sourced from the International Trade Administration. There are 8 classifications for the data, with each exponentially increasing. Many states, for one reason or another, have low overseas tourism, so smaller and less uniform classes were necessary to create a nice gradient in the dataset. The map can be retrofitted to fit any dataset from the International Trade Administration related to overseas visitation from other calendar years.
